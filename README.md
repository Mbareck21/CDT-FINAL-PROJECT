# Legal-Inquiry-Submission
Link =>  https://legal-inquiry.herokuapp.com/

This is a functional App allowing clients to submit legal inquiries to their lawyers online. I built this using Bootstrap and EJS to render the front-end interface; Node.js to implement the back-end user authentication based on whether they are users or admins; and MongoDB to dynamically store and persist data. I deployed the app on Heroku so that it is accessible anywhere.
