# Legal-Inquiry-Submission
Link =>  https://legal-inquiry.herokuapp.com/

This is a functional App allowing clients to submit legal inquiries to their lawyers online. I built this using Bootstrap and EJS to render the front-end interface; Node.js to implement the back-end user authentication based on whether they are users or admins; and MongoDB to dynamically store and persist data. The App uses Passport authentication methods to ensure only the registered user or admin can access the restricted page where all inquiries are stored after logging in. The App also allows the user/admin to implement CRUD methods. I deployed the app on Heroku so that it is accessible anywhere.
