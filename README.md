# Legal-Inquiry-Submission
Link =>  https://legal-inquiry.herokuapp.com/

Welcome to our online legal inquiry app! I built this platform to allow clients to easily and securely submit legal inquiries to their lawyers from anywhere. I used Bootstrap and EJS for the front-end interface, Node.js for back-end user authentication, and MongoDB to store and persist data. I also utilized Passport authentication to ensure that only registered users and admins can access the restricted page where all inquiries are stored. With our app, users and admins can easily implement CRUD methods to manage their inquiries. I deployed the app on Heroku, making it accessible from any device with an internet connection. I hope you find our app helpful in streamlining your legal process!
